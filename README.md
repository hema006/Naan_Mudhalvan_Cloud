Deploying a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant and interacting with it on messaging platforms involves several steps. 
**Prerequisites:**
1. An IBM Cloud account: You will need an IBM Cloud account to access Watson Assistant services.
2. A messaging platform account: You'll need an account on the messaging platform where you want to deploy your chatbot (e.g., Facebook for Facebook Messenger, or Slack for Slack).
3. Basic knowledge of IBM Cloud services and the chosen messaging platform.

**Step 1: Create a Watson Assistant Instance:**
1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
2. Go to the IBM Cloud Catalog and search for "Watson Assistant."
3. Create a new Watson Assistant instance.

**Step 2: Build Your Chatbot:**
1. In the Watson Assistant dashboard, create a new chatbot by clicking "Create assistant."
2. Train your chatbot using intents, entities, and dialog nodes.
3. Define the responses and dialog flows for various user inputs.

**Step 3: Test Your Chatbot:**
1. Test your chatbot within the Watson Assistant dashboard to ensure it responds correctly to sample inputs.

**Step 4: Deploy Your Chatbot:**
1. Go to the "Deploy" section within Watson Assistant.
2. Choose the integration option that matches the messaging platform you want to use (e.g., Facebook Messenger or Slack).
